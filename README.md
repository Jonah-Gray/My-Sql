# My-Sql
This is the 2nd project with the Just-IT bootcamp,
<p>This project involved us using MySQL to solve problems by giving us a prompt to create a query that would return certain information.
It also included creating a report with brief explanations to explain the code and show your understanding of the content.</p>
<p>It was a quick project designed to see if we remembered when and how to use the keywords correctly in the course.</p>
