# My-Sql
This is the 3rd project with Just-IT
This Task involved us using MySQL to solve some problems by giving us a prompt to create a query that would return certain information.
It also included creating a report with brief explanations to explain the code and show your understanding of the content.
<p>It was a quick project designed to see if we remembered when and how to use the keywords correctly in the course.</p>
